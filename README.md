This is the code designed and built for an Android project while completing my Masters in Advanced Software Engineering in University College Dublin. 

The code is for an Android application which builds open an existing opensource application (https://code.google.com/p/open-gpstracker/) to provide a run tracking and training service. The existing application was forked and the required changes were made. 

The project received an A grade. It was never published.
